For deploying to multiple website, [this resource](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/multisites#set_up_deploy_targets) was useful. I had to create a new `index.html` inside the `source/` directory to route users to our login page.

### Multiple deployment websites
Currently, there are two deployment "targets": `testing-stegosource-9lives`, and `stegosource-9lives`. These are defined in `.firebaserc` under "targets". If you access the firebase console, and click on the "hosting" section in the left tab bar, you will see 2 sites.

These 2 sites are also defined in the `firebase.json` file. You will see two different "target"s in the "hosting" array, they are identical except for the name since we want them to deploy the same files (the `source/` directory).

### Setting firebase CLI and actually deploying
You can install the firebase CLI through npm, and login in through your google account. [This link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli) can help you with that. 

Setting up the deploy targets can be done with the following command:
```
firebase target:apply hosting TARGET_NAME RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER
```
Again the first link can help you with that, note that the `TARGET_NAME` and `RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER` I defined are the same names. For example the command I ran to connect the target `stegosource-9lives` with the hosting site `stegosource-9lives.web.app` is `firebase target:apply hosting stegosource-9lives stegosource-9lives`.

 I'm still not sure if you have to redefine the 2 targets that I originally set up, or you can simply deploy to either of them using the command `firebase deploy --only hosting:TARGET_NAME` (where `TARGET_NAME` is either "stegosource-9lives" or "testing-stegosouorce-9lives).


### Automated github workflows
There are currently 2 new workflow/github actions that can be found in the `.github/workflows/` folder.
- firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml - whenever a PR made, firebase will automatically deploy to a temp URL the PR's files and append that link as a comment on the PR. This is a good way to get a good preview of incoming changes and we can take a look/test it.
- firebase-hosting-merge.yml - this deploys to our primary site "stegosource-9lives" when a merge is made to `main`
