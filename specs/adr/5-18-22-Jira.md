## Context and Problem Statement
We were using Jira and Zapier for automated ticket creating with github. The team liked using Jira since it had sprint planning features and roadmaps that github didn't provide. To accomplish this we had to enforce branch and issue naming conventions for Zapier to turn github issues into Jira tickets. However our free trial for Zapier ended up expiring, and we aren't able to automate the process anymore.

## Considered Options
* we can continue to use Jira except now people or a team member(s) would have to manually create Jira tickets corresponding to github issues.
* we just don't use Jira anymore, and use other methods to plan our sprints and roadmap

## Decision Outcome
Our team decided to to not use Jira anymore, and use alternative ways to keep track of stories. We will still enforce branch naming conventions though for readability.
