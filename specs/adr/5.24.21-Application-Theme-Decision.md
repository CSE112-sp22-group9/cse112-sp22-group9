## Context and Problem Statement
[For our bullet journal, we originally wanted to switch between a default and seasonal theme for user customizability since we initially wanted to store our data locally and 
thought that we would have more time to implement this additional feature. However, as made clear in another ADR decision, we decided to
use an actual database to store the data in our bullet journal so that we could account for our daily photo album feature. This took a significant amount of time, 
so our team had to figure out how to still incorporate a unique theme to our bullet journal application with the time constraints.]  

## Considered Options
* user customizability (design personalization)
* having a single unique theme based around our team logo & brand and just have color customizability


## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "[Having a unique set semi-seasonal theme centered around our team logo and brand]" because we decided to now have a unique set theme based on seasons which relates to our team logo, mascot, and brand. 
This unique theme will set us apart from others and still provide the user with a unique bullet journal theme.
